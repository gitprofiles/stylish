# What is this?

When using the builder, it needs to show previews. The builder expects the below.

- about-me.tsx
- connection.tsx
- detailed-project.tsx
- work-place.tsx

They must have the respective props as well. You can find these on offical templates such as gitprofiles/stylish on GitHub.

Relative imports are not allowed either.
